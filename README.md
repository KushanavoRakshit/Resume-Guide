ðŸ“‘ Resume-Guide

During the internship cycle 2025-26, I searched multiple resources online to create a LaTeX-based resume. However, most resources were either too complex or not user-friendly.

To solve this, I curated and designed my own LaTeX resume templates:

âœ… 1-Page Resume

âœ… 2-Page Resume

These templates are simple, clean, and easy to customize for your needs.
Feel free to download, edit, and use them for your own resumes! ðŸš€
